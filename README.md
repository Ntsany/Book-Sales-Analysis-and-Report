# Book-Sales-Analysis-and-Report

This project is focused on analyzing book sales and ratings data to uncover trends and patterns. It involved integrating the dataset into Airflow, cleaning and validating the data, and automating the pipeline to post data to Elasticsearch. Insights were visualized using Kibana, highlighting the dominance of low-priced books ($0â€“$4) and fiction books in sales. The project provided recommendations to optimize pricing, focus on key genres, and enhance distribution strategies for improved sales performance.
